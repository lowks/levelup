Merge 2 strings
===============

Consider 2 strings of A and B, implement a function that returns a merge of these 2 strings with relative to their position, the result should always return in capital letter. In the case that 1 of the string is longer than the other, the rest of the remaining character should go at the end of the returned string. For example:
a. “ABCDEF” and “GHIJKL” should merge into “AGBHCIDJEKFL”
b. “HELLO” and “WORLD” should merge into “HWEOLRLLOD”
